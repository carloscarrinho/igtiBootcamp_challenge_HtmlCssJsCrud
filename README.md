# HTML, CSS and Javascript CRUD
## This is the first challenge from IGTI JS Fullstack Developer.
The objective was to create an interface to register users using only HTML, CSS and Javascript to practice DOM manipulation (elements, events, etc.) and the Single Page Application (SPA) concept.

This challenge did not ask for advanced CSS practices, but I thought it would be nice to develop a good looking interface, so I've made some styles upgrades and the possibility to switch to the dark theme.
